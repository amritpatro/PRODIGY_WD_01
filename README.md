### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create an interactive and visually appealing navigation menu for a website focused on cars. The navigation menu remains fixed at the top of the page and changes its background color when the user scrolls down. This provides immediate visual feedback to the user, making the navigation experience more engaging and intuitive. The project uses HTML to structure the menu, CSS to style it, and JavaScript to add interactivity.

### HTML Structure
The HTML file structures the navigation menu and the content of the webpage. It includes:
- A `header` element with a `nav` element inside it, which contains the navigation bar.
- An unordered list (`ul`) for the menu items, with each item (`li`) being a hyperlink (`a`) that links to different sections of the page.
- A `main` element that contains the main content of the page, including sections with headings, paragraphs, and images.

### CSS Styling
The CSS file styles the navigation menu and the content sections. Key styling elements include:
- **Fixed Position**: The navigation menu has a fixed position at the top of the page, ensuring it remains visible as the user scrolls.
- **Background Color**: The navigation bar has a transparent background that changes to a dark color when the user scrolls down the page.
- **Hover Effect**: The font color of the menu items changes when the user hovers over them, providing immediate visual feedback.
- **Responsive Design**: The navigation menu is designed to be responsive, adjusting its layout and appearance based on the screen size and device.

### JavaScript Interactivity
The JavaScript file adds interactivity to the navigation menu. Key functionalities include:
- **Scroll Event Listener**: The JavaScript code listens for the scroll event and toggles a class on the navigation bar based on the scroll position. This class change triggers the CSS transitions for the background color.
- **Hover Effect**: The JavaScript code handles the hover effect for the menu items, changing their font color when hovered over.

### Detailed Breakdown
1. **HTML**:
   - The `header` element contains the navigation bar (`nav`) with a logo (`div`) and a list of menu items (`ul`).
   - The `main` element contains sections with headings, paragraphs, and images that provide content about cars.

2. **CSS**:
   - The `body` element is styled with a dark background color and white text.
   - The `header` element is styled to be fixed at the top of the page with a transparent background that transitions to a dark color when scrolled.
   - The `nav` element is styled with padding and flexbox properties to align the logo and menu items.
   - The `ul` element is styled with flexbox properties to space out the menu items.
   - The `li` elements are styled with hover effects to change the font color when hovered over.

3. **JavaScript**:
   - The JavaScript code adds an event listener for the scroll event. When the user scrolls down the page, the `navbar` element's class is toggled to add the `scrolled` class, which changes the background color.
   - The JavaScript code also handles the hover effect for the menu items, changing their font color when hovered over.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to create an interactive and visually appealing navigation menu using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The fixed position of the navigation menu ensures it remains accessible at all times, while the color and style changes provide immediate visual feedback to the user. The responsive design ensures a consistent experience across different devices, making the navigation menu both functional and user-friendly. Feel free to customize the styles and functionality to suit your specific needs and preferences!
